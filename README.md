# syncevents
Wordpress plugin to sync Facebook page events with the Wordpress plugin [Events Manager](http://wp-events-plugin.com/)

## Getting started

### Installing
- Get the zip file at the [Release page](https://github.com/Konkrad/syncevents/releases/)
- upload it to your Wordpress Installation ([see Wordpress manual](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation))
- active the plugin

### Setting things up
- get a long living API Key ([see this blog post](https://medium.com/@Jenananthan/how-to-create-non-expiry-facebook-page-token-6505c642d0b1))
- get the id of your Facebook Page ([have a look at this handy tool](https://findmyfbid.com/))
- go to the general settings page in the Wordpress Admin panel
- enter both the API Key and the page id in the settings section of this plugin

The events should now be synced twice a day
